# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Moment JS.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with Dates and intervals on JavaScript, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Comparing dates are confusing and I am taking it slowly.

### Day 2: September 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: (Still) Playing with Moment JS.

**Thoughts:** I finally managed to create some diffs, refactor steam event schedule using Array for moments. Tomorrow will be making the project look alike [the real site](https://www.whenisthenextsteamsale.com/). I learned how to set a listener yesterday, and today I found out a bug which happens because I don't remove that listener on page unmount (Yeay!).
