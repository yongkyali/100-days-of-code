# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Moment JS.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with Dates and intervals on JavaScript, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Comparing dates are confusing and I am taking it slowly.

### Day 2: September 10th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: (Still) Playing with Moment JS.

**Thoughts:** I finally managed to create some diffs, refactor steam event schedule using Array for moments. Tomorrow will be making the project look alike [the real site](https://www.whenisthenextsteamsale.com/). I learned how to set a listener yesterday, and today I found out a bug which happens because I don't remove that listener on page unmount (Yeay!).

### Day 3: September 11st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first project.

**Thoughts:** Completed the project. Do replace some repepetitive code as one reusable function. Got inspired and powered by Lando Norris's vibes after watching McLarens's YouTube Channel. Overall great day of code with no problems!
